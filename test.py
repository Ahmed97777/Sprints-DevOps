# the assert equal wont work here because our output of the function is a string containing
# two answers
# if there is an assert equal to compare strings we can use it well.

# so here is an example of the function outputs and what the output should be.
list = [5.0,5,3,2,2]
MyFunc(list) 
# answer should be the max float value is 5.0  and the mean of the even is 3
